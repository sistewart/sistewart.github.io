        <h2>Let's talk about my favorite NBA teams!</h2>
    
        <p>I am an avid lover of watching the NBA. Many teams are so different in terms of how they are structured, so it's very fun to see how they compete against one another. Teams consist of 15 active players and a coaching staff. My favorite teams in the NBA are based off of their potential, and these teams change every season.. I love to watch teams that are underdogs become champions. For example, the 2015-2016 Cleveland Cavaliers team was the underdog to win the 2016 NBA Finals, but they succeeded, bringing the first major league sports team championship to Cleveland, Ohio after 52 years. Teams like this are why I love the teams in the NBA and watching them.The National Basketball Association Teams are divided into two conferences: the Eastern and Western Conference with 15 teams each.</p>
      
        <h3>These are the teams in each conference, broken down by their standing for the 2018-2019 season.</h3>
