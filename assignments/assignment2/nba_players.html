        <h2>Let's talk about my favorite NBA players!</h2>

        <p>The players are my favorite part of the NBA. They always come out with a passion and drive to win every night they have a game. Men from all across the world come to play in the NBA, and it is seen as the most competitive league in the world. There are only 450 men that are able to play in the NBA. With 30 teams, each one can only have 15 players on the team. Based off of last season's roster, at least 100 players came from different countries in the world. This shows how much the NBA is growing in terms of distinction.</p>
