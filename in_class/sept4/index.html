        <h2>Let's talk about the National Basketball Association!</h2>

        <p>This assignment is about one of my most favorite things in the world: the National Basketball Association. Basketball is my favorite sport (even though I can't play it). The National Basketball Association, the NBA, is one of the four major league sporting leagues in North America for men. It was formed in 1949 as a merger between two different organizations: the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America. Today, there are 29 teams in the U.S. and one team in Canada. The NBA is usuallly seen as the premier men's baksetball league in the world because basketball players come from all over the world come there to play.</p>
